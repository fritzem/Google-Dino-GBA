# Notes
Referenced the original [chromium source](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:components/neterror/resources/offline.js;l=7?q=t-rex%20package:%5Echromium$&ss=chromium) heavily.
Game has been balanced to run as the actual game plays in a 240p sized window. The max speed was scaled down the same way the starting speed is scaled down in the original game.
